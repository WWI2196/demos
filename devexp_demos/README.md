Demo applications used by the Dart & Flutter Developer Experience team.

These applications consist of Dart & Flutter apps that are used for local
testing of tools like Flutter DevTools, Flutter & Dart supported IDEs, and the
Dart Analysis Server. Some apps may have also been used for user experience
testing.

There is no guarantee that these apps will be further maintained or kept up to
date with the latest Dart and Flutter versions.
