# How to Contribute

This repo is for code that supports talks, blogs, and experiments. The code is unmaintained and presented "as-is".  As such, the repo is not monitored for pull requests and/or issues, and you likely don't want to spend time contributing.

**If you're on the Dash team at Google,** this repo is appropriate for **any** demo, sample, experiment, etc that you don't want to commit to maintaining. This repository is a catch-all for code that just doesn't belong anywhere else.

For example:

- Demos for talks, events, workshops, or tied to a timeline in some way.
- Sample apps that are in-progress.
- Sample apps that are tied to experimental features.
- Sample apps in which the running demo app is more important that the code itself.
- Code that just doesn't belong anywhere else.
- **Any code that shouldn't be advertised as having best practices or being up to date.**
