# How to Contribute

This repo is for code that supports talks, blogs, and experiments. The code is unmaintained and presented "as-is".  As such, the repo is not monitored for pull requests and/or issues, and you likely don't want to spend time contributing.

**If you're on the Dash team at Google, and you want to add a new demo**, you're free to do so. There are no requirements.
